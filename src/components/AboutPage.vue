        What is OpenBudget?
      </h5>
      <p>
        OpenBudget was created as a visualisation tool for public spending, and for comparing how different countries spend their budgets. 
        In 2020, as public spending is poised to break records because of the COVID-19 crisis,
        it aims to give answers about what makes the bulk of public spending in different countries,
        and how they compare with each other with regards to budget allocation.
      </p>
      <h5 class="question">
        What public expenditures are included?
      </h5>
      <p class="answer">
        Data shown on OpenBudget is a combination of public spending at the Central Government, State Government, and Local Government levels.
        Therefore, spending by subnational entities (e.g. a U.S. State) is included in the data shown.
        Social security spending is also included. As a consequence, when pensions are financed through the public sector,
        they count as public spending, whereas pensions that come from private pension plans are not represented.
      </p>
      <h5 class="question">
        Where did the idea behind OpenBudget come from?
      </h5>
      <p>
        On July 2020, Banque de France Governor Villeroy de Galhau declared 
        "Our [French] public social model is too costly. 55% of our national wealth is spent in public spending
        whereas our European neighbors with a similar model spend 45%". This prompted me (RaphaÃ«l Merx)
        to dig deeper into where the majority of public spending goes, and how it varies by country.
        Realising that I could find budget visualisations for each country, but no standardised visualisation
        for comparing countries, I set out to build OpenBudget.
